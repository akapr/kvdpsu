<p>
This page lists restaurants that we know and either love or hate in Pittsburgh. The opinions here are our own, and try to be as honest and brief as possible. The listing is alphabetical. Maybe later when it is larger, we'll list by category as well.
</p>

<p/>

<dl>

<dt><b>Cafe at the Frick (Clayton)</b> - North of the Frick Museum</dt>

Great desserts, soup, sandwiches, lunch, sunday tea. Make reservations.

Good Sushi and other Japanese food. Nice hot pots. Get the live scallop if they have it.

Stay Away.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Chopstick Inn</b> - Mcyntire Square, off Mcknight Rd, North
Hills.</dt>

</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Il Piccolo Forno</b> - 21st and Penn, Strip.</dt>

Antonio's Italian bakery. Great pastas and salads for lunch. Stupendous breads, cakes, and pastry.

<P>
Sometimes it's great, sometimes it sucks.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>La Cucina Flegrea</b> - Murray Ave, halfway down the hill.</dt>

Best Italian in Pittsburgh. Go on Wednsdays for Risotto Night.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>La Prima Espresso</b> - 21st and Penn, Strip</dt>

Good general Chinese. Not as good as other favorites.
</p>
</dd>

Transcendent hot dogs. More fries than a human can consume. Dirty, greasy, possibly dangerous.

Those wierd-ass sandwiches with fries and slaw on them.
