and brief as possible.  The listing is alphabetical. Ratings are:

<dl>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> 61C Cafe</b> - Murray Ave,
  at the bus stop</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Coffee isn't great, but the place is wonderful.<br>
<P><P>Roger: Too open for me--I don't want to hear the couple next to me fighting. 
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Alla Famiglia</b> - Allentown</dt>
<dd>
<P>
<P><P>Roger: Scary neighborhood, top notch Italian food, in a pleasant room with great
  service. 
Easy to spend $150 for a couple. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Atria's</b> - Warrendale, North side, other places</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Steaks, burgers, general american food, good service, great with kids.<br>
<P><P>Roger: A little too much like TGIF for me. 
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Bangkok Balcony</b> - Squill, Forbes ave.</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Reasonable Thai at reasonable price.  Good service.  Interesting 
atmosphere. Strange silverware.  Try to sit in the solarium part to 
have a nice view of Forbes Ave. <br>
<P><P>Roger: We concur.</b></p>
</dd>

<dt>Baum Vivant - Baum Blvd.</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: High End Spanish/French food. I like it. I know people who don't.<br>
<P><P>Roger: Don't get me started. Last time I ate there, I threw
up. General attitude of &quot;We're really sophisticated, aren't we?&quot;</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Benkovitz</b> - The Strip, Smallman Street</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Good fish market that also has a fried-fish counter with great 
fish sandwiches. Crowded.<br>
<P><P>Roger: Fun when you're in the mood.
</p> 
</dd> 


<dt>Bravo - Everywhere</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Mediocre pasta and such. Offensively expensive.<br>
<P><P>Roger: Just downright sucky. 
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/><img src="unread.tiff"/> Cafe at the Frick (Clayton)</b> - North of the Frick Museum</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Great desserts, soup, sandwiches, lunch, sunday tea. Make reservations.<br>
<P><P>Roger: One of the best places in town. You can only make reservations if you're a member. 
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Cafe Zinho - Shadyside</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Seems interesting at first, until you realize it isn't. Extremely inconsistent.<br>
<P><P>Roger: Owned by the Baum Vivant charmers. Bad hotel food in a funky setting created
by
the previous owner (who actually had a personality). One of Pittsburgh's top
restaurant
critics
described
the
owner
in terms
I will not repeat in decent company.
Told
you
not to get me started. 
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Caruso's</b> - Mt. Leb</dt>

</dd> 


<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/><img src="unread.tiff"/> Casbah</b> - In Shadyside on Highland Ave.
<dd>
<p>

  is worth.
  <br />
  <P><P>Roger: A reliably nice place to take company, if you don't mind the big ticket
  (big for Pittsburgh, anyway). Sunday brunch is good too. 
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/><img src="unread.tiff"/> Chaya</b> - Murray Ave, halfway down the hill.</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Good Sushi and other Japanese food. Nice hot pots. Get the live scallop

</dd>

<dt>Chopsticks - Squirrel Hill</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Stay away.
  <br />
  <P><P>Roger: Far, far away. Actually I think they're out of biz. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Chopstick Inn</b> - Mcyntire Square, off Mcknight Rd, North
Hills.</dt>
<dd>
<P>

<dd> 
<P> 
Pete: Unique Decor. Excellent chocolate cake. Good beer and  
pizzas as well (the southwestern pizza is really unique).

</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Clem's BBQ</b> - Way east</dt>
<dd>

  barbequeue.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Coffee Tree</b> - Squill, Forbes Ave, other places</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Brewed coffee is consistently excellent. Espresso is uneven. Good hot chocolate.

</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Craig Street Coffee</b> - Craig St.</dt> 
<dd>

</dd>  

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> De Luca's</b> - Strip</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Best breakfast in the city, probably. <br />
<P><P>Roger: Yummy 2,000 kcal breakfasts. </p>

<dd>
<P>
    Pete: Almost always open.  Great with kids.
      <br />
      <P><P>Roger: How can you review Eat 'n Park in this city? It's part of the &quot;culture.&quot;
      McDonald's with servers. I hate it. </p>
</dd>

<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: "If you are thinking 'Meat, meat.  I need more meat.  Where is the 
damn meat?' this is a pretty good place."  The cold bar is more than 
tolerable, too. <br />
<P><P>Roger: Did Pete mention the meat? Atkins heaven. Not half bad. </p> 
</dd>

<dd>
<P>
Pete: Enjoyable faux-Mex. Lots of beer and drinks. Loud.

</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Original Hot Dog Shop ("The O")</b> - Oakland, CMU</dt>

</dd> 


<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Penn Brewery</b> - North Side</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: German-themed brew pub with good beer and mostly okay food. Home of Penn
  
Pilsner, Penn Dark, etc, etc. <br />

</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> The Quiet Storm (*)</b> - Penn Avenue</dt> 
<dd> 
<p>

decent coffee. <br />
<P><P>Roger: I can't take the hippie thing. 
</p> 
</dd> 


<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/><img src="unread.tiff"/> Regina Margherita</b> - Bellevue, Lawrenceville</dt>

</dd>


<dt>Sharp Edge - East Liberty, near Whole Foods</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Good beer, bad food.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Spice Island Tea House - Oakland.</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: This place used to be stupendous. Now it is not.

</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Sushi Too, Sushi Two</b> - Shadyside, South Side</dt>
<dd>
<P>
<P><P>Roger: Friendly, reliable. My default &quot;let's do sushi&quot; place. Not as yummy
  as Umi and Chaya, but cheaper and far easier to get into. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Tasty</b> - In Shadyside on Highland Ave in the plaza just before the bridge.
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Some excellent home style Cantonese. Order off of the "Hong Kong" menu
only.
<br />
<P><P>Roger: Looks like a flourescent plastic Chinese takeout place and, if you don't
order the right stuff, will serve food just like that. But if you avoid that
stuff, it's probably the best Chinese in Shadyside.</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/><img src="unread.tiff"/> Taco Loco</b> - Carson and 17th. South Side.</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Real mexian in Pittsburgh. Great tacos and other dishes.
  <br />
  <P><P>Roger: Low end and very yummy. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Tessaro's</b> - Bloomfield, Liberty Ave</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Local bar. Stupendous burgers. Probably the best in the city. Can be slow.
  <br />
  <P><P>Roger: Good burgers but pretty everything else is mediocre. </p>
</dd>

<dt>Thai Place Cafe - Craig St.</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Offensively bad Thai. 
</p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Tonic</b> - Downtown</dt>

  plate.
</p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Tram's</b> - Bloomfield</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Good Vietnamese food. Pho, noodle bowls, some "special dishes".
<br />
<P><P>Roger: Atmospherically scary, not for the faint of heart, which for me is a bonus
on top of the good food. </p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Udipi Cafe</b> - Old Willima Penn highway, Monroeville</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Probably won't get better South Indian near here. Lots of traffic from

</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/><img src="unread.tiff"/> Umi</b> - Shadyside, Ellsworth</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: High end Japanese. Very expensive, very good. Unclear if it's worth it.
  The fixed price tasting menu (Omakase) is nice.
  <br />
  <P><P>Roger: My favoriate sushi, mostly because of atmosphere. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Uncle Sam's</b> - Oakland, Squirrel Hill, others</dt>
<dd>
<P>
Pete: Good cheesesteaks. Some gripe about the bread and/or the fries. The one
  in Oakland is better.
  <br />
  <P><P>Roger: Hate. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Vendetta Dolci (*)</b> - South Side</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Contributed: Italian/Mediterranean place started by the former pastry chef from
   Abruzzi. High-end food at middle-of-the-road prices, never a long 
wait for a table. Great desserts.  </p> 
</dd> 

<dt>
<b><img src="unread.tiff"/><img src="unread.tiff"/> Vivo</b> - Lincoln Ave. in Bellevue.
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Italian-ish. Very expensive. Very excellent. No credit cards.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="unread.tiff"/> Zaw's</b> - Murray Ave, down the hill.</dt>
<dd>
<P>

  <br />
