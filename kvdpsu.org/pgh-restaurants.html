<p> This page lists restaurants that we know and either love or hate
in Pittsburgh.  The opinions here are our own, and try to be as honest
and brief as possible.  The listing is alphabetical. Ratings are:

<dl>
<dt>
<p>
<font color="red">No bullets</font>: Stay away.
<dt>
<p>
<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> A good place.
<dt>
<p>
<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> A really good place.
</dl>

<p>
For places where we disagree, the final rating is up to the judgement of the editor.
Places  marked with a (*) are second hand from people we mostly trust.

<dl>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> 61C Cafe</b> - Murray Ave,
  at the bus stop</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Coffee isn't great, but the place is wonderful.<br>
<p>Roger: Too open for me--I don't want to hear the couple next to me fighting.
<p>Anu: All scene, no bean.
<p>peterb: Meh.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Abay</b> - Shady Ave. at Penn, near Whole Foods</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Ethiopian food. They get points just for being there. This is not my personal thing, but people I trust like it.
</dd>

<dt><font color="red">Ali Baba</font> - Oakland, Craig St.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Used to be the only middle eastern food around here. Now it's just one of several lame places.
<p>
Roger (<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>): My Israeli friend thinks it's lame, but it's my favorite Middle Eastern food. Yummy baba ganoush and sleek. Good with kids.
<p>
Anu: Tastes better if you're a student, otherwise keep it to lunch.
<p>
Paul: A bowl of the Syrian soup and a shared small plate of baba ganooj make
for a reasonable lunch.  The former is pretty good.  The latter is
variable, but never bad.
<p>peterb: Try the Sleek.  My biggest problem with this place is that even when no one is in it, it is tragically overcrowded and uncomfortable.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Alla Famiglia</b> - Allentown</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<p>Roger: Scary neighborhood, top notch Italian food, in a pleasant room with great
  service. 
Easy to spend $150 for a couple. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Atria's</b> - Wexford, North side, other places</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Steaks, burgers, general american food, good service, great with kids.
<p>Roger: A little too much like TGIF for me. 
<p>peterb: The beer is overpriced, and the food is "OK" but not memorable.  It's a good place for work-related lunches, for some reason.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Bangkok Balcony</b> - Squill, Forbes ave.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Reasonable Thai at reasonable price.  Good service.  Interesting 
atmosphere. Strange silverware.  Try to sit in the solarium part to 
have a nice view of Forbes Ave. <br>
<p>Roger: We concur.</b></p>
<p>Anu (<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>): Try the mussaman curry or fried fish in chili sauce
</dd>

<dt><b>Baum Vivant</b> - Baum Blvd (<b>Closed</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete (<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>): High End Spanish/French food. I like it. I know people who don't. 
<p>Roger: Don't get me started. Last time I ate there, I threw
up. General attitude of &quot;We're really sophisticated, aren't we?&quot;</p>
<p>peterb: I would say this place is pretentious, but I think you are only pretentious if you aren't actually as good as you act.  I think this place is as good as it acts.  It's the best French(ish) food in town, and worth the high price.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Benkovitz</b> - The Strip, Smallman Street</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Good fish market that also has a fried-fish counter with great 
fish sandwiches. Crowded.<br>
<p>Roger: Fun when you're in the mood.
</p> 
<p> 
Paul: When the weather turns cooler, the chowder at the soup
counter can't be beat.  Utter chaos on Lenten Fridays.  
</p>
<p>peterb: There is a place in the universe for frozen deep-fried clam strips.  Benkovitz fills that need.  Everything tastes better when deep-fried.</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Bona Terra</b> - Sharpsburg</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: A good place for any city. Recommended.
<p>
Roger: Surprisingly high end for Pittsburgh. One of the city's few real restaurants, kind of like a real city would have. 
</dd>

<dt><font color="red">Bravo</font> - Everywhere</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Mediocre pasta and such. Offensively expensive.<br>
<p>Roger: Just downright sucky. 
<p>peterb: It's a tasteless, soulless chain, but to make up for it, the prices are really high.</p>
</p>
</dd>

<dt><font color="red">Bruschetta</font> - Carson St.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Anu: Highly over-rated; only go for lunch or if you can't get into Dish and desperately want pasta.
</p>
<p>peterb: They pronounce their name "Brush-ettta's."  That's all you need to know.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Cafe Allgero</b> - South side, off Carson</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Roger: Back when Pittsburgh didn't have many nice restaurants, we had Cafe Allegro. It was great then and, despite all the new competition, it still is. The servers are top notch.
</p>
<p>Pete: Went there once a long time ago, and remember that it was very good.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Cafe at the Frick (Clayton)</b> - North of the Frick Museum</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Great desserts, soup, sandwiches, lunch, sunday tea. Make reservations.<br>
<p>Roger: One of the best places in town. You can only make reservations if you're a member. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: The Chef here recently retired, I have not been back since and cannot say if things are different.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Cafe Grand Canal</b> - Sharpsburg</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Excellent pasta, transcendent cannelloni with ground veal and bechemal. 
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Cafe Du Jour</b> - South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Interesting, decent food served by total flakes.
</p>
<p>
Anu:  Great for lunch (sausage & brie sandwich!), usually good for dinner but potentially inconsistent.  The outdoor garden is one of the better settings to eat.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><font color="red">Cafe Zinho</font> - Shadyside</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Seems interesting at first, until you realize it isn't. Extremely inconsistent.<br>
<p>Roger: Owned by the Baum Vivant charmers. Bad hotel food in a funky setting created by
the previous owner (who actually had a personality). One of Pittsburgh's top
restaurant critics described the owner in terms I will not repeat in decent company. Told you
not to get me started. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Caruso's</b> - Mt. Leb</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Pizza. Good pizza.  </p> 
</dd> 


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Casbah</b> - In Shadyside on Highland Ave.
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Reasonably good mediterranean-ish food. Too often more expensive than it
  is worth.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: A reliably nice place to take company, if you don't mind the big ticket
  (big for Pittsburgh, anyway). Sunday brunch is good too. 
<p>
Paul: All about the brunch for us, particularly during the warmer months in
the "patio" area.  They use actual yogurt on the granola.
</p>

</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Charina's</b> - South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Anu: Good & not greasy -- Wonderful sleek.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Chaya</b> - Murray Ave, halfway down the hill.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good Sushi and other Japanese food. Nice hot pots. Get the live scallop
  if they have it.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: One of Pittsburgh's better sushi places. </p>
  <p>Anu: Good sushi; be prepared to get scolded for your eating habits.
</dd>


<dt><font color="red">Cheesecake Factory</font> - South Side, Coming soon</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: I don't understand these places. Why sit in a 2 hour line to get mediocre food and an oversized piece of cheesecake?
</dd>


<dt><font color="red">Chopsticks</font> - Squirrel Hill</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Stay away.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Far, far away. Actually I think they're out of biz. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Chiodo's </b> - Homestead (<b>Closed</b>)</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Great dive bar. Lots of beer. Try the Mystery Meat Sandwich, which is a great value.
<p>
Roger: Typical bar food but a great beer selection and a pleasant place to hang out.
<p>peterb: I believe this place has closed, unfortunately.  It wasn't good, but it was cheap.</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Chopstick Inn</b> - Mcyntire Square, off Mcknight Rd, North
Hills. (<b>Closed</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: This place is now <b>closed</b>. Good Cantonese with perhaps the biggest menu in the area. Get the seafood. </p>
<p>
The space has reopened under different ownership as China Star
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Christo's</b> - Sixth Street</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Good Greek food. Get the "Jackie O" cake.</p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b> The Church Brew Works</b> - Liberty Ave</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: A beer place. I never found the food that great.
  <p>Roger: A fine brew pub. Poor acoustics is my only complaint. </p> 
<p>
Paul: A divided space between a high-rent bill of fare and
pub food, plus a collection of decent beers.  Loud.
The pepperoni pizza is a surprising win, and all the
desserts involve malt in some fashion. 
</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Clem's BBQ</b> - Way east</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Decent ribs. The pulled pork is OK, but doesn't taste like real southern
  barbequeue.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Coca Cafe</b> - Lawrenceville</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Where hip pre-gentrified Lawrencville neighborhood people go for mediocre breakfast.</p>
<p>peterb: I think the breakfasts here are pretty good, and there's a variety of options and OK coffee.  There's a bit of a lack of yummy meat options, but the interesting omelettes and panini make up for it.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Coffee Tree</b> - Squill, Forbes Ave, other places</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Brewed coffee is consistently excellent. Espresso is uneven. Good hot chocolate.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: I don't drink coffee but the wife loves it. </p>
  <p>Anu: Brewed coffee is excellent, great place for beans (espresso beans can rival La Prima).
</dd>

<dt><b>Craig Street Coffee</b> - Craig St.</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Crappy coffee. I wil never forgive them for throwing out the name Bunznudders.
<p>
Contributed (<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>): Best veg and non-veg soup selection in the city.  More sandwich 
options than you've ever encountered. 
</p> 
</dd> 


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Crepes Parisienne</b> - Shadyside</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: OK crepes, but too pricey. 
</p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> D's Six Packs & Dogz</b> -  Regent Square</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Anu: Not quite O quality, but great with Chili or Chicago style.  Amazing beer bottle selection and great rotating features on draft.  Good for a quick bite before an artsy movie.
</p> 
<p>
Pete: Credible Chicago dog. Not crusty like I like them, and too much bun, but yummy. The fries are really good, really good. Actually better than the O fries.
</p>
<p>peterb: I actually think I prefer D's to the O.  A lot of that might be the atmosphere, and the superior selection of condiments.</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Dave and Andy's </b> - Atwood St, Oakland</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Really really really good local ice cream shop. Don't go anywhere else
  for cones. If I see you in a Cold Stone or something, I'll cut you.
<p>Roger: Agree, but the room is coldly industrial at best. </p>
</dd>  

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> De Luca's</b> - Strip</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: One of the better breakfast places in the city, but nowhere near great.<br />
<p>Roger: Yummy 2,000 kcal breakfasts. </p>
<p>peterb: It's a pit, but it's a pit with really good bacon.  The coffee is substandard (and getting worse over time)</p>
</dd>  

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Dish</b> - 17th Street, South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: A surreal zone of uber-hipness in the middle of the South Side. Great appetizers and mediterranean/Italian pasta, meat and seafood dishes. Really good, maybe my favorite in the city. <i>No credit cards</i>.
<p>
Anu: Great but small space, great but small menu with consistently good specials (2-3/night), fun staff.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Eat 'n Park </b> - Everywhere</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Pete: Almost always open.  Great with kids.
      <br />
      <p>Roger: How can you review Eat 'n Park in this city? It's part of the &quot;culture.&quot;
      McDonald's with servers. I hate it. </p>
</dd> 


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Enrico Biscotti</b> - 20th St. and Penn, Strip and Shadyside. </dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Great biscotti, cookies, and other delights. The cafe in the back, which was one of the best food places to ever exist in Pittsburgh is now open only on weekends. The Shadyside location is not even close to the same.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Two of my favoriate places in the city. Top notch. </p>
  <p>Anu: I'll miss the chaos of eating lunch in the Strip.</p>
<p>peterb: The place in Shadyside is exactly as bad as the place in the strip was good.  The food is almost the same, but the atmosphere is all wrong.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Enrico's Tazzo D'Oro</b> - Shadyside</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Not at all related to the other Enrico's. Decent coffee, funky place.
<p>
Anu: Good coffee, decent lunch fare, great place to read the sunday paper.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> The Falafel Guy </b> - Truck at Hillman Library</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Good Falafel.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Authentically yummy. 
</p> 
<p>
<b>Note</b>: He is now running a new place called LEENA's. Added a new entry.
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Fat Heads</b> - South Side, Carson and 18th or 19th.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good wings, lots of beer, huge sandwiches that don't suck much. Very loud.
<p>
Anu: Great bar food with great beer; the beasty barbecue sauce is perfection.
</p>
<p>peterb: Their wings have declined in quality dramatically over the past few years.  Stick to the sandwiches.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Frankfurters</b> - Lincoln Ave. in Bellevue</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Great hot dogs. I like the O better.
</p> 
<p>peterb: They have birch beer, and good hot dogs.  Not quite as great as D's.</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Girasole (*)</b> - Shadyside</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Contributed: Good Italian, nice atmosphere, excellent ravioli and tiramisu. Smallish.
  LOUD.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Nice place that seriously needs some acoustic tiling. Competent food,
  good service. </p> 
<p>
Paul: The trick to eating here is getting a table on the patio when the
weather is nice; considerably less noisy. We've never had a bad meal.
</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Green Forest</b> - 655 Rodi Rd.</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: My friend Alex says, "If you are thinking 'Meat, meat.  I need more meat.  Where is the 
damn meat?' this is a pretty good place."  The cold bar is more than 
tolerable, too. <br />
<p>Roger: Did Pete mention the meat? Atkins heaven. Not half bad. </p> 
</dd> 

<dt><font color="red">Gullifty's</font> - Murray Ave</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: AVOID. Used to be an  OK place for desserts (the killer cookie was awesome). Now there is no reason to go.
</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Il Piccolo Forno</b> - 21st and Penn, Strip.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Antonio's Italian bakery. Great pastas and salads for lunch. Stupendous
  breads, cakes, and pastry.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>Il Pizzaiolo</b> - Mt. Leb</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: <em>Snarky review removed because I haven't been to the place in probably ten years</em>. I defer to Anu
<p>
Anu : Swanky authentic pizza in Mt. Lebanon; not quite RM but very good.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Jimmy Tsang's</b> - East Liberty</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Back in the day this was the dark-red-tablecloth-plastic-chair-generic-chinese from hell. I've never been back.
<p>
Paul(<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> ): We always eat in the Korean section, which unfortunately is either
"smoking" or "excessively smoking", being very near the bar.  On a
cold winter night, a bowl of the Duk Guk is a fine thing indeed.
</p> 
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Ka Mei Cantonese Food (*)</b> - Murray Ave, across from Jerry's</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: This is the reincarnation of Tasty, which is now under new owership. It's the same excellent Cantonese food that Tasty used to have, it's just in Squirrel Hill instead of Shadyside. Giving it an extra bullet because I missed it.
</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Kashmiri Food Cart (*)</b> - Outside Hillman Library</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Contributed: Excellent and cheap indian food.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: Construction in the area means that these guys have moved or closed down. Not sure what their status is.
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Kaya</b> - Strip</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Sometimes it's great, sometimes it sucks.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: I agree about the inconsistency, but I like it a lot. Another competent
  Big Burrito restaurant. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Kassab's</b> - South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good middle eastern food. My Israeli friend says it's the best Middle Eastern place in town. Recently moved to new, much cleaner, location.
<p>
Anu: Good and greasy. Good sleek.
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Kazansky's</b> - Murray Ave, down the hill</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Reasonably enjoyable deli stuff. Nice maztoh ball soup. Uniquely dumpy
  atmosphere.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Pete is dead on. Place desperately needs a makeover. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Kenny B's</b> - Sixth Street (<b>Closed</b>)</dt>        
<dd>                 
<p>                                                   
Pete: Diner-ish sandwich shop with a selection of decent Cuban food. Good media
   noche sandwich, good cafe con leche, good flan. OK breakfast. Reuben.    
<p>
</p>                                                        
</dd>            

<dt><font color="red">Kiva Han</font> - Craig St, also down Forbes in Oakland.</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Offensively bad coffee.  OK light-snacks food. 
</p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Klavon's</b> - Penn Ave, Strip.</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Transcendent milkshakes. Neat old drug store soda fountain.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: My favoriate ice cream place in the city. </p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Kleiner Deutschmann</b> - Springdale</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Paul: German food in a converted house, painted pink, crammed to
the gills with barogue kitsch, and the staff wear peasant dresses or
lederhosen, as appropriate.  Food is great.  Dining is cramped, and
there isn't really a non-smoking section; if someone lights up in the
smoking area, the whole floor gets a taste.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> La Cucina Flegrea</b> - Murray Ave, halfway down the hill.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Best Italian in Pittsburgh. Go on Wednesdays for Risotto Night.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Windowless but yummy. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> La Feria</b> - Walnut St.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good but a bit boring. Up very many steps.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Limited selection but reliably tasty Peruvian food.
</p>
<p>
Paul: Never any reason not to get the sweet potato chips as an appetizer,
and no point in ordering off of anything but the specials board.  Often
have interesting cold soups in the warmer months.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> La Foret</b> - Shadyside</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Impressively excellent French food. Don't get anything with bok choy in
  it.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: The place has a pleasant intimacy. </p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> La Prima Espresso</b> - 21st and Penn, Strip</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: The best coffee in Pittsburgh, period. Don't even bother going anywhere
else. Really I'm not kidding. If I find you elsewhere in the Strip, I'll throw coffee at you.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> La Strada (*)</b> - Downtown</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Contributed: "Happening" place for high-powered business meals.  Great lunch
buffet. 
</p> 
</dd> 


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Legends of the North Shore (*)</b> - North Side</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Contributed: Relaxed mostly-Italian food. Good soup, nice lunch menu. 
</p> 
<p>peterb: This place is reliably very good.  I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip (as I would for Cucina Flegrea), but it's probably your best option for good food in the North Shore, and serves better Italian than most of the Bloomfield places.</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Leena's</b> - Oakland Ave.</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Good Falafel. This is run by the guy that used to have the blue truck called Leena's. Same good Falafel.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Authentically yummy. 
  </p>
  <p>
	This place is where Swagath used to be.
</p>
</p> 
<p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Le Pommier</b> - Carson St. South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Bistro style French. Very good, but a bit uneven. Get the Creme Brulee.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Lidia's</b> - Strip</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good Italian.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Mama Lena's</b> - McKee's Rocks</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Paul: Good local pizza joint.  Get the Sicilian pie.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Mad Mex</b> - Oakland, North Hills, Mt. Leb</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Enjoyable faux-Mex. Lots of beer and drinks. Loud.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Best Mexican-ish food in Pittsburgh. Oakland place is so loud I won't
  go there. </p>
  <p>Anu: great wings.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Milky Way</b> - Murray Ave</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Vegatarian and Kosher. Good pizza and falafel.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: A welcome alternative in the Murray Ave area. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Mitchell's Fish Market</b> - Waterfront</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good seafood near the Loews theaters.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Not nearly as good as the OFM downtown. (Both restaurants are ripoffs
  of the theme from Boston and are unrelated.)</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Monterey Bay Fish Grotto</b> - Mount Washington</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good fish and such. Nice view.
  <p>Roger: Silly name and equally silly decor, but one of the best seafood places in town. 
  Awesome view. The bar is good too.</p>
<p>
Paul: One of the best meals I've ever had, sitting in the ghetto in back
facing west, watching a storm roll in.  They don't overcook the fish.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>My Thai</b> - Shadyside, 2nd floor, corner of Walnut and Aiken</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Generic boring Thai food in Shadyside. Used to be better. Removing the bullet.
<p>Roger: There are two Thai places in Shadyside. This is the better one by far.
  Service is very efficient and friendly. </p>
<p>
Paul: Very, very nice.  The crispy duck is great.  Ask for the condiment dish.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><font color="red">Nakama</font> - Carson and 17th</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Roger: The cheesy Benihana schtick lives! Nakama is to Japanese cuisine as P.F. Chang's is to Chinese. Utterly lacking in subtlety and grace. Was that butter you just slathered on my over-grilled shrimp? On the other hand, the kid loved the goofy chef show. 
 </p>
</dd>


<dt><font color="red">New Dumpling House</font> - Murray Ave</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Chinese and sushi. Stay away.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: The place exudes scary, but I've had okay sushi there. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Ocha Catering Cart</b> - Hillman Library</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Paul: Great Thai lunch truck food served up by the folks who run the
never-seems-to-be-open eatery in Verona.  The specials are usually great.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><font color="red">Olive Garden</font> - Everywhere</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: The Olive Garden is a great evil that stains our very existence and threatens everything good that we believe in.
</dd> 

<dt><b>Opus</b> - Downtown, Reanaissance Hotel, I think</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Pretentious, expensive, boring.
<br />
<p>Roger: Cool lobby, big wine list (and wine bar), very good service, competent but uninspired food. 
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Orient Kitchen</b> - Oakland, Baum Blvd.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good general Chinese. Not as good as other favorites.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Original Fish Market</b> - Downtown</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good fish and sushi. Open late.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Good food, good service. </p>
  <p>Anu: Fish Market: non-sushi quality has been inconsistent lately; many mediocre entrees hiding in the menu.  Get sushi or something simple (hong kong style fish).
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Original Hot Dog Shop ("The O")</b> - Oakland, CMU</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Transcendent hot dogs. More fries than a human can consume. Dirty, greasy,
  possibly dangerous.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: An institution. A frightening institution. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Outback Steakhouse</b> - North Side, McCandless, others</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Chain "Australian-themed" steakhouse.  Good burgers & ribs. </p> 
</dd> 

<dt><font color="red">Pamela's</font> - Oakland, Squill</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: I don't understand why people like this place. Greasy, thin, practically
  deep fried pancakes, nothing else that great.<br />
  <p>Roger: I concur. Gross. </p>
<p>
Paul: My body can no longer handle the grease.
</p>
<p>peterb:  Everyone who stands on line to get in here on Saturday morning is going to Hell.</p>
</dd>  

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Pandolfo's</b> - South south south</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good breakfast in the south hills. Much better than Pamela's.
</p>
</dd>  


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Palomino</b> - Downtown</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Chain with upscale, chic atmosphere and tasty 
neo-Mediterranean food. <br />
<p>Roger: A cliche, but an okay one. </p> 
</dd> 



<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Penn Brewery</b> - North Side</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: German-themed brew pub with good beer and mostly okay food. Home of Penn
  
Pilsner, Penn Dark, etc, etc. <br />
<p>Roger: Inconsistent food, sometimes dead cold. Beer is yummy. </p> 
<p>
Paul: The food is variable, but usually reasonable; they can be forgiven
much for their beer.  Go in March and get a pull of the Martzen.
</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> People's Indian</b> - Bloomfield</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Paul: Pretty good Indian,, somewhat standard menu.  They are not afraid to
make the food spicy.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Pierogies Plus</b> - Mckee's Rocks</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Hand made Pierogies. Awesome.
<p>
Anu: Eat them there, dripping with butter.
</p>
</dd> 
 
<dt><font color="red">P. F. Chang's</font> - Waterfront</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Offensively bad Chinese. I have <a href="http://www.tgr.com/weblog/archives/000091.html">further thoughts</a> on this.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: I agree with Pete except that it's not Chinese. </p>
<p>
Paul: Favorite house flavoring ingredient seems to be propane.  Hideous.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>Piccolo Forno</b> - Butler St, Lawrenceville
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Took over the old Regina Margherita store. Salads, wood fired pizza and Carla's homemade pastas. Easily some of the best Italian food anywhere. Run by the same people who brought you Il Piccolo Forno in the strip.
<br />
</dd>

<dt><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> <b>Piper's Pub</b></font> - SouthSide</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Yummy huge dishes of hot food that will kill you. The scotch egg is terrifying.
<p>Anu: High quality brit-pub food with a good selection of beer and whiskey; They graciously handle big groups.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Pittsburgh Deli Company (*)</b> - Copeland Ave, Shadyside</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Contributed: High-quality deli food.  Great vegetarian offerings.  Wide  
beer selection. <br />
<p>Roger: Surprisingly good deli. 
</p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>Point Brugge</b> - Point Breeze</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Excellent fries and decent versions of various Belgian standards. Good mussels when they are in season.
</p> 
</dd> 


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Primanti Brothers</b> - Strip, Oakland.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Those wierd-ass sandwiches with fries and slaw on them. Sublime in their own twisted way.
<p>Roger: Sick making. 
</p>
<p>
Paul: Somewhat addicting high-test piles of sandwich.  They'll yell at you
in the Strip if you order it wrong.
</p>
<p>peterb: The great secret of Primanti's is to go there in the morning and get a bacon-and-egg sandwich (or, if you're eating there, just a bacon and egg plate).  It's a yummy (if deadly) breakfast.</p>

</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> The Quiet Storm (*)</b> - Penn Avenue</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Contributed: Hippie-ish coffee place with lots of vegetarian and vegan options; does
periodic good veggie brunches and dinners. Fabulous espresso milkshakes, 
decent coffee. <br />
<p>Roger: I can't take the hippie thing. 
</p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Red Hot and Blue</b> - Waterfront</dt>

Pete: Real. Pulled. Pork. Finally. Go. Now.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Roberto's Pizzaria</b> - Bellevue</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Great pizza. Expensive. This is the renamed Regina Margherita. Same pizza, different name.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: My vote for best pizza in the city. </p>
  <p>Anu: great desserts & coffee too.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: The Lawrenceville store is closing. So I took if off the list. They also changed names.
</dd>

<dt><B><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Rose Tea Cafe</b> - Forbes Ave near Shady in Squill</d>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Forget the bubble tea, get the homey Taiwanese peasant food. This is my favorite current Chinese food in the city limits. It's good enough to go to even if you just spent time in a city with a real Chinatown.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><B>South Side Steaks</b> - South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: The grill guy gave me the finger for snapping a photo. Then we got two sandwiches which were all wiz and no steak.
<p>
Anu (<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>): What was inconsistent, is now usually great: "Original Wit Wiz".  Stay away from the fries.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Soba</b> - Shadyside</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Only went once. Expensive and not so interesting. Fusion offends me.
<p>
Anu: A great space with great fusion pan-asian food; if that concept doesn't offend you, you'll love it.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><font color="red">Spice Island Tea House</font>- Oakland.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: This place used to be stupendous. Now it is not.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: I can't remember when it was stupendous. Very greasy. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Square Cafe</b> - Braddock Ave, Regent Square</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good breakfast and lunch. No nonsense. Great with kids.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b>Sushi Too, Sushi Two</b> - Shadyside, South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Warm sushi on bad rice. Never liked it.

<p>Roger (<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>): Friendly, reliable. 
My default &quot;let's do sushi&quot; place. Not as yummy as Umi and Chaya, but cheaper and far easier to get into. </p>
<p>Anu: The sushi is almost always nasty; stick to Shadyside location.  Haven't tried the korean.
<p>peterb: There are atmosphere differences between the two locations.  The people at the South Side location are nice and friendly and make you feel welcome.  The people at the Shadyside location hate you, and want you to die.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>Taqueria Mi Mexico</b> - Murray Ave, Squill (<b>Closed</b>)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Great tacos and tortas. Other interesting Mexican dishes. Insanely cheap. Go now. A second nice Mexican place to go along with Taco Loco.
<p/>
<p>peterb: I love this place.  Although not on the menu, the soups (consomme, menudo) are great, when they have them.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Tasty - In Shadyside on Highland Ave in the plaza just before the bridge.
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: The original owners sold out but have reopened a new place in Squirrel Hill called Ka Mei. I have not been back recently, so am updating the entry.
<br />
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Taco Loco</b> - 27th and Jane, South Side.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Real Mexican in Pittsburgh. Great tacos and other dishes.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Low end and very yummy. </p>
  <p>Anu: Chorizo gordita is heaven on earth.  BYO six-pack from the Carson St Deli across the street.
  <p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Tessaro's</b> - Bloomfield, Liberty Ave</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Local bar. Stupendous burgers. Probably the best in the city. Can be slow.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Good burgers but pretty everything else is mediocre. </p>
<p>
Paul: The burgers are all.  If you ask for a rare burger, they will actually
serve one.  Great tin ceilings.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><font color="red">Thai Place Cafe</font> - Craig St.</dt>

Pete: Offensively bad Thai. 
</p>

<dd> 
<p> 
Anu: Greasy & nasty; and yet the gyro omelette is wonderful.
</p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Tonic</b> - Downtown</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Nice bar with a mix of creative small and large dishes. Get the veggie
  plate.
</p> 
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Tram's</b> - Bloomfield</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good Vietnamese food. Pho, noodle bowls, some "special dishes".
<br />
<p>Roger: Atmospherically scary, not for the faint of heart, which for me is a bonus
on top of the good food. </p>
<p>
Paul: Great pho, great spring rolls, great table coverings.
</p>
<p>peterb: I love this place.  There's not a lot of options vis-a-vis the pho (no tripe, for example), but the broth is superb.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Typhoon</b> -  Highland Ave</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Pete: Pretty, blue, hip, boring.
</p>
</dd> 

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Udipi Cafe</b> - Old Willima Penn highway, Monroeville</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Probably won't get better South Indian near here. Lots of traffic from
  the Temple. Good Dosa.
</p>
<p>
Paul: Utensils strictly optional.  Get the Paper Masala Dosai for a meal
that verges on the architectural.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Umi</b> - Shadyside, Ellsworth</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: High end Japanese. Very expensive, very good. Unclear if it's worth it.
  The fixed price tasting menu (Omakase) is nice.
  <p />
  <p>Roger: My favoriate sushi, mostly because of atmosphere. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Uncle Sam's</b> - Oakland, Squirrel Hill, others</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good cheesesteaks. Some gripe about the bread and/or the fries. The one
  in Oakland is better.
  <p />
  <p>Roger: Hate. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Vendetta Dolci (*)</b> - South Side</dt> 
<dd> 
<p> 
Contributed: Italian/Mediterranean place started by the former pastry chef from
   Abruzzi. High-end food at middle-of-the-road prices, never a long 
wait for a table. Great desserts.  </p> 
</dd> 

<dt>
<b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Vivo</b> - 565 Lincoln Ave. in Bellevue.
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Expensive for the Pittsburgh area, but clearly one of the best places in town on every level. A wide range of different stuff made with the best ingredients Sam can find. Very excellent. You have to go. Now. 

<p>
<b>They take credit cards now.</b>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Zaw's</b> - Murray Ave, down the hill.</dt>

  <p>Roger: On the oily side, but tasty. </p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dt><font color="red">Zyng</font> - Murray, near Forbes</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Roger: May be worse than P.F. Chang's. You can do better at the food court in a mall. Walk half a block to Rose Tea Cafe, where you'll have great Asian food cheaper. 
<p<p>

  <p>Pete: I haven't been here, but just looking at the sign and the front window fills me with fear. </p>
  <p><b>Closed!</b></p>
