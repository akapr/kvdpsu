<p>
This page lists restaurants that we know and either love or hate in Pittsburgh. The opinions here are our own, and try to be as honest and brief as possible. The listing is alphabetical. Maybe later when it is larger, we'll list by category as well.

<dl>
<dt><b>Casbah</b> - In Shadyside on Highland Ave.

Reasonably good mediterranean-ish food. Too often more expensive than it is worth.
</dd>

<dt><b>Chaya</b> - Murray Ave, halfway down the hill.
<dd>
<P>
Good Sushi and other Japanese food. Nice hot pots. Get the live scallop if they have it.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Chopstick Inn</b> - Mcyntire Square, off Mcknight Rd, North Hills.

Biggest Chinese menu that I know of. Lots of excellent and more unusual dishes. Try the Pork Belly. Don't get takeout.
