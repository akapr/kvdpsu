<h2>Pittsburgh Restaurant Microreviews</h2>

<p>
This page lists restaurants that we know and either love or hate in Pittsburgh. The opinions here are our own, and try to be as honest and brief as possible. The listing is alphabetical. Maybe later when it is larger, we'll list by category as well.
</p>

<p/>

<dl>
<dt><b>Casbah</b> - In Shadyside on Highland Ave.
<dd>
<p>
Reasonably good mediterranean-ish food. Too often more expensive than it is worth.
</dd>

<dt><b>Chaya</b> - Murray Ave, halfway down the hill.
<dd>
<P>
Good Sushi and other Japanese food. Nice hot pots. Get the live scallop if they have it.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Chopstick Inn</b> - Mcyntire Square, off Mcknight Rd, North Hills.
<dd>
<P>
Biggest Chinese menu that I know of. Lots of excellent and more unusual dishes. Try the Pork Belly. Don't get takeout.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Enrico Biscotti</b> - 20th St. and Penn, Strip.
<dd>
<P>
Great biscotti, cookies, and other delights.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Fat Heads</b> - South Side, Carson and 18th or 19th.
<dd>
<P>
Good wings, lots of beer, huge sandwiches that don't suck much.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Il Piccolo Forno</b> - 21st and Penn, Strip.
<dd>
<P>
Antonio's Italian bakery. Great pastas and salads for lunch. Stupendous breads, cakes, and pastry.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>La Cucina Flegrea</b> - Murray Ave, halfway down the hill.
<dd>
<P>
Best Italian in Pittsburgh. Go on Wednsdays for Risotto Night.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>La Prima Espresso</b> - 21st and Penn, Strip
<dd>
<P>
The best coffee in Pittsburgh, period. Don't even bother going anywhere else.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Mad Mex</b> - Oakland, North Hills
<dd>
<P>
Enjoyable faux-Mex. Lots of beer and drinks. Loud.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b>Orient Kitchen</b> - Oakland, Baum Blvd.
<dd>
<P>
Good general Chinese. Not as good as other favorites.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Original Hot Dog Shop ("The O")</b> - Oakland, CMU
<dd>
<P>
Transcendent hot dogs. More fries than a human can consume. Dirty, greasy, possibly dangerous.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Primanti Brothers</b> - Strip, Oakland.
<dd>
<P>
Those wierd ass sandwiches with fries.
</p>

Some excellent home style Cantonese. Order off of the "Hong Kong" menu only.
</dd>

<dt><b>Uncle Sam's</b> - Oakland, Squirrel Hill
